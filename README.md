This repository contains the design files for a NOR flash based addon for the original xbox video game console. The design uses the MAX V CPLD from Intel and the SST39VF168X line of NOR flash devices from Microchip. It includes both the hardware (schematic and layout) and software (vhdl sources) required for its implementation.

The Schematic and Layout was done using the free version of DIPTRACE (http://diptrace.com). In addition, the vhdl HW design was implemented using the free version of the Intel (formerly Altera) Quartus software and their USB-Blaster II programmer.
