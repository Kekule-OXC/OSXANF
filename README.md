This repository contains the design files for a NOR flash based addon for the original xbox video game console. The design uses the MAX V CPLD from Intel and the SST39VF168X line of NOR flash devices from Microchip. It includes both the hardware (schematic and layout) and software (vhdl sources) required for its implementation.
